                <li>
                    <p>There's really not much to say about this silly little brick you've stubled upon, it's an Anker PowerCore Essential 20000 bought at a car boot sale ages ago and doesn't even have a USB-C output 
                        (thank god it at least has a USB-C input though lol)
