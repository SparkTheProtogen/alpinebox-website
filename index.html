            <h3>Ask Sadie if you want web services done (FTP servers, Email accounts, Link shortening and Subdomains etc!) Her discord is "singestheos" :D</h3>
            <p>I guess there's not much text here, well for starters the font here is Liberation Sans (or Arial bold if that fails to load), I load the font from the server though so unless it's blocked there should be no issue there.
                I want to put a microblog of sorts up on this website but I am so utterly uninteresting that I would not have much content to put on there so I just update the gallery every once in a while.
            </p>
            <p>Below you can see an update log for the website, it took a lot of work to get this site in the state you see right now.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>This website is a work in progress if it was not obvious enough, so sit tight while my creativity bleeds dry.</p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <p>[25/06/2025] I created the blog style page hinted at in the text above.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[24/05/2025] One more image has been added to the gallery.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[19/04/2025] I re-installed the OS on the server and now I have a better source of documentation and a larger package selection.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[15/01/2025] I changed the background for the index page and started work on a useful links page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[30/12/2024] I updated the gallery page with 13 more images!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[17/11/2024] I reversed the gallery order so tiles are ordered newest-first and I did some minor tweaks to how the caption divs behave</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[13/11/2024] I reversed the update log so the newest entries are at the top after my friend pointed out how odd the original layout was.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[12/11/2024] I updated the gallery page with three more images.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[11/11/2024] I added alt text to all the images in the gallery like I should have done when the site was created.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[23/09/2024] The techspecs page is now fixed (again) and there is no longer an awkward 2mm step between the header and the page content below it due to improperly defined bounds of the header element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[22/09/2024] I have properly defined a font for this website to use so hopefully everything displays correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[21/09/2024] This website now has HTTPS and a new font.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[10/08/2024] The techspecs page is finally responsive!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[03/08/2024] The captions for the gallery sub-pages are something more meaningful than "awawawa"</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[28/07/2024] New URL!! (alpinebox.singestheos.com), HTTPS is coming soon but god is it difficult! (Custom Dockerfile :3)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[25/07/2024] Website update! I have decluttered this page and improved navigation across pages.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[26/07/2024] I started running my own local DNS through pihole</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>[25/07/2024] I've got Docker working and moved to a containerised version of Nginx!</p> 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I really need something else to put here...</p>
