            <h3 class="center"> Blog? Microblog? Text wall? Whatever you call this, it's probably that. Have fun reading my incoherent ramblings (or don't, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> if you so wish)</h3>
            <p>This is a page where I will note down many of my fragmented, unfiltered thoughts I have, trigger warnings will be denoted appropriately<br>This page will be making heavy use of the
                <code>summary</code> and <code>details</code> tags, all modern browsers should support these and if you somehow load this page on a browser that doesn't then congrats! That is soley a you problem to have <3 /p </p>
            <p>It is a good idea to use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> keyboard shortcuts to scale this page on your side, as it contains only swathes and swathes of text so nothing is lost when
            scaled up/down.</p>

                <summary>25/06/2025 - Life is giving it to me up the bum, and it's all my fault :) [TW: s/h, suicide]</summary>
                <p>I wish I wasn't so fucking stupid, every day at work I try to meet quota but I rarely do, I try to work at the same speed everone else does but I always manage to fuck up somewhere,
                    Every time I ask for help I'm filled with anxiety that I'm bothering people and could be progressing on my assigned tasks that I'm already behind on, but each time I don't ask for help
                    I manage to leave the simplest of things unchecked and look like a fucking idiot when someone with a higher skill level looks at what I've done. Better yet, no matter how I denote the
                    time I start a task be it a bit of masking tape with a timestamp or a stopwatch on my phone I always manage to overshoot the bare minimum of what's expected of me (usually I take over twice 
                    what is expected of a complete novice, and I've been there for six months), and I get told this every once in a while, but nothing ever happens, so I live in fear of the consequences coming my way
                    due to my own incompetence. That and sometimes a few (3) out of the usual ~12 people in the same room as me start taking notes from the monkeys at the zoo, I try to focus on what I've been told to do and
                    usually a few strange noises emanating from the corner opposite me every now and again is fine, sometimes there's even some Sleep Token lyrics embedded in those alien tongues you speak, but sudden screeching
                    <i>at the top of your fucking lungs</i> is taking the piss (you know who you are.), I get it, the radio's off and it's my fault, I'm sorry I just appeared one day and fucked everyone's day up, I'm sorry, but please, is it really that
                    difficult to have at least a shred of consideration for other people? Every time I ask myself this I wonder if I'm the issue here, maybe I'm the one that needs to stfu, maybe I need to fucking change and stop being
                    such an arrogant shit stain and mind my own business while ignoring the pain, because if I can ignore it then it's probably not important, and there's other priorities I have in life, like pulling my finger out of my ass
                    and being normal, being anything other than the inadequate, challenged, lobotomised twat I am currently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I wish I could change who I am, I wish I could forcefully reset my personality and general identity, I don't want to be who I am now, I'm never enough, I take forever to process even the simplest of things
                    and I constantly let down anyone around me, it hurts knowing I'm a disappointment to my parents, tutors, supervisors and more. I wish I had the courage to take that rope and end it all, just need to check if a 5mm rope
                    can hold my weight and if that bridge I was looking at is high enough, printed instructions on tying a slip knot could also come in clutch cos I know some subhuman cunt is going to rob my dead body and if I survive (unfortunately)
                    I don't want to lose my phone, as it is rather expensive and has a LOT of shit on it.
                </p>
                <p>Recently I also learned that pursuing happiness is a lost cause, everything I do for fun (like updating this site, endlessly trying to find time to breathe new life into old projects and having
                    all those ideas sit endlessly in markdown files on my phone for eternity) always comes at a cost, which is always falling behind on things that are actually important like college mainly
                    For example: Had fun with friends on minecrap? Could have been doing college work. Finally shaved legs for even a minute amount of gender euphoria? Got distracted and left chores too late.
                    Even when I have ONE (1) thing to do (e.g. Being physically in college and having assignment work open) I still manage to fail because I can't focus, Noise cancelling headphones used to help but
                    they don't really work anymore, mainly because it's difficult to suppress the huge amount of anxiety that comes with detaching myself from my surroundings, this is also why I study ~21:00 - ~01:30 because wearing
                    headphones when my parents are awake and happen to want something from me has irreversibly scarred me in the past, it seems, <i>anyway,</i> Even when I *can* focus in college it's never for long enough
                    and I really don't have it in me to invoke those actually successful study sessions (my best is about six hours straight if we ignore the piss breaks that had to be taken) and even when I do it's always too late.
                    One time I actually finished up an assignment (Took me from 00:00 - 06:00, 20/05/2024 iirc) but clearly that was wrong because my dad got pissed off I was up at 6AM, so I'm really fucking struggling to see the point anymore,
                    if I try to pidgeonhole myself into traditional study methods and that doesn't work, and I get punished for attempting something that does, then what the fuck do I do then? And for the rare occasions I can sit down
                    to focus on my college work it's never enough, I sit there and blankly stare at my monitor, periods of up to two minutes elapsing between keystrokes, and at the end of these "study" sessions I just can't feel anything,
                    I just want to slit my fucking wrists and watch the blood pool onto the floor, but I can't even styro myself right, the sharpest things in this fucking house are the fucking butter knives after all, that and
                    scar tissue is a lot harder to cut, even if it's inelastic it still moves with the surrounding skin and slings blood drops everywhere while I desperately slash at my arms trying to feel something validating,
                    trying to feel like I'm doing something right, finally feeling the pain I deserve for being such a burden to everyone I interact with on a daily basis.<br><br><br><i>what an opener am I right? (Kill me now, please.)</i>
