            <p>Now that I started paying attention to it, it is really difficult to find a sodium lamp in use anywhere apart from illuminating long stretches of road nowadays, they have a really distinct monochromatic yellow / orange glow so if you ever encounter one be sure to take a picture of it! 
                You'll never know if that will be the last orange lamp post you ever see D:
