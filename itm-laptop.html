            <h3 class="center">You seem to have read the info QR on my laptop so here's a brief overview:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> It is an Acer TravelMate B311-31 with 4GB RAM (DDR4 at 2400MT/s, non-removable) and 64GB of eMMC storage (also non-removable), this laptop is powered by an 
                    absolute gaming beast of a CPU: the Intel Celeron N4120 running at a maximum clock speed of 2.5GHz and an Intel UHD
                    Graphics 600 iGPU.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> As for software it is running Arch Linux (btw) with Sway as its window manager, I chose a tiling WM as this screen is tiny, 
                    partitioning it between apps and removing the ability to minimise apps ensures I only have apps I am actively using open therefore 
                    saving resources AND the mouse is used less as more actions relating to launching, closing and moving applicaions now have keyboard 
                    shortcuts assigned to them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> This page is meant to be viewed on mobile so if it looks a bit empty that means you are most probably on a tablet or a desktop</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
