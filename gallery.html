          <div class="caption">
            <p><a href="./gallery/pretty_cloud.html">This is a stunning picture of a cloud I took while out on a walk, in reality I couldn't see 3m in front of me without a light source, Pixel night mode really shines through here.</a></p>

          <div class="caption">
            <p><a href="./gallery/clouds.html">This is a picture I took by pointing my camera into the clouds when it was almost pitch black out, works well as a background don't you think?</a></p>

          <a href="./gallery/stanley.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/pussy-t.jpg" alt="An image of a cat asleep on a windowsill resting its head on a white folded towel. There is a passing car vivible out of the window behind although greatly out of focus."></a>

            <p><a href="./gallery/stanley.html">This is a photo of Stanley, my boyfriend's cat, he is very fluffy however most of the time he's super shy, however when he isn't he is super friendly! sadly his presence triggers my allergies uwu</a></p>

There is an orange light in the distance from a rail signal."></a>
          <div class="caption">
            <p><a href="./gallery/rails_dark.html">This image goes along with the reocurring theme of pointing the camera into the sky and hitting the shutter button, I really do need more interesting things to take pictures of, like <a id="lamp-post" href="http://blobbyspurplesite.raspberryip.com/photos-DSC00643.html">lamp posts</a> for example, 
              if I could capture the ever decreasing presence of a lamp post boasting a traditional sodium lamp that woulkd be cool...</a></p>

          <div class="caption">
            <p><a href="./gallery/rails_path.html">I really love how the clouds turned out here, this was taken as one of a series of photos to see what the "Save RAW images" (Something like that ig) option does on Pixel phones and what format it saves it in, Because every manufacturer needs a different RAW format of course! Standardisation is kinda cringe anyway.</a></p>

          <p><a href="./gallery/lamp_post.html">Well, I managed to capture a specimen in its' urban habitat however it is the much less rare LED (or CFL?) variant, not the dim orange sodium lamp variety I was hoping to capture.</a></p>

        <div class="caption">
          <p><a href="./gallery/sunset.html">I took a picture of a sunset, not much to see in this picture but I'll try to capture the sky in its' various other hues someday.</a></p>
