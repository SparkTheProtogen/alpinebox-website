    <p class="center">Here are some noteworthy photos I took using either my phone (Google Pixel 7) or camera (GoPro HERO9), I hope you'll enjoy viewing them as much as I enjoyed taking them ^w^ </p>

      <a href="./gallery/transmission_towers.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/transmission_towers-t.jpg" alt="A few transmission towers standing tall against a plain grey sky with a few buildings obscuring the lowest parts."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/transmission_towers.html">I was heading to a family member's to configure their smart lock and as we were crossing this industrial area this sight caught my eye and I took a few pictures.</a></p>

    <!--odd machine-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/odd_machine.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/odd_machine-t.jpg" alt="A peculiar yellow vehicle with 8 wheels and bald tires, 4 on the front and 4 on the back, the cab is missing the lower door portion and a bit of the engine is exposed in front of the cab."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/odd_machine.html">I saw this peculiar machine under the overpass at the end of the path I was following and took a picture, later conversing with my dad I learned it was a variation of road roller.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--nightpath-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/nightpath.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/nightpath-t.jpg" alt="A twisting path running along an empty road which is equally as straight with some woods on the left of the image and a railway roughly 20 metres to the right of said road."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/nightpath.html">I decided to take a picture using night mode as anything in this general direction was appearing pitch black and it did a decent job of brightening up the scene.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--rail pylons-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/rail_pylons.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/rail_pylons-t.jpg" alt="A picture of a railway with several pylons in the foreground and a multitude of streetlights in the background."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/rail_pylons.html">I like the raw industrial style this image gives off, not much else to say here...</a></p>
      </div>

    <!--industrial1-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/industrial1.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/industrial1-t.jpg" alt="A picture of a railway slightly obscured by a tree and some other objects."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/industrial1.html">I tried to replicate the look of some of the first images on this site as there was a railway near where I was staying for the holidays.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--spotlight-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/spotlight.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/spotlight-t.jpg" alt="A beam of light standing out clearly against the dull grey sky with the source covered by various houses, bushes, etc."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/spotlight.html">Between the houses there was a strangely placed field, and due to the darkness I could see a very clear spotlight shining into the sky, how strange...</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--balanced-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/balanced.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/balanced-t.jpg" alt="A photo where the camera is looking directly down a path, with a road and some trees planted alongside it visible on the right and a row of houses on the left."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/balanced.html">I took this image to try to try to show off the vaguely orange streetlights but automatic colour correction makes that really difficult.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--graffiti-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/graffiti.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/graffiti-t.jpg" alt="The bottom section of a soviet era flat covered in dense graffiti."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/graffiti.html">I passed this wall one day and it piqued my interest due to the similarity / contrast to other graffiti I have seen.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--waters sunset-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/waters_sunset.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/waters_sunset-t.jpg" alt="A photo of a sunset with the sky in a beautiful gradient going from sky blue to orange down the image."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/waters_sunset.html">I was out on a walk when I saw this beautiful sunset and decided to take a picture, I think it turned out great :3</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--misty-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/misty.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/misty-t.jpg" alt="An image depicting an eerie fog settled above a stream with the moon illuminating the scene causing the whole scene to be rather dull and muted."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/misty.html">This photo was taken long before this website was created, I love the muted colours paired with how the fog settled near to the ground.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--exposure streaks-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/exposure_streaks.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/exposure_streaks-t.jpg" alt="A photo looking out of the right side window of the bus, depicting a deep blue sky with silhouettes of trees smudged across it and streaks created by headlights of other cars due to the vehicle's movement."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/exposure_streaks.html">Following on from the previous photo, this one turned out a lot better with the smudged headlights and more blur (being locked to auto mode when taking photos 
          is annoying so I have to take advantage of the autofocus having a moment every now and again.)</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--window view-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/window_view.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/window_view-t.jpg" alt="A photo looking out of the right side window of the bus, depicting a deep blue sky with silhouettes of trees smudged across it due to the vehicle's movement."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/window_view.html">This image was taken when I was incredibly bored on the bus ride home and decided to experiment with long exposure photography from a moving vehicle.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--winter clouds-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/winter_clouds.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/winter_clouds-t.jpg" alt="A photo taken pointing up at the clouds which are illuminated by the moonlight with a silhouette of a leafless tree on the right of the image."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/winter_clouds.html">My partner pointed out the clouds one night and they were super pretty!!</a></p>

      <a href="./gallery/loaf.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/loaf-t.jpg" alt="A photo of a white cat loafing on the arm rest of a sofa."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/loaf.html">This is my boyfriend's other cat Casper, he's not shy at all and meows super loudly he's just so cute awawawa<br>I wonder what he's thinking about...</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--sunset-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/sunset.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/sunset-t.jpg" alt="An image of the sky taking up the upper three quarters of the image  shifting from a light blue to a more orange hue going down the image with a few clouds in the distance on the left, there is a silhouette of the treeline taking up the bottom quarter of the image."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/sunset.html">I took a picture of a sunset, not much to see in this picture but I'll try to capture the sky in its' various other hues someday.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!--lamp post-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/lamp_post.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/lamp_post-t.jpg" alt="A blurry photo of a lamp post under an overpass with a traffic jam visible on the right of the image, the only light sources are the lamp post and the brake lights of the cars."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/lamp_post.html">Well, I managed to capture a specimen in its' urban habitat however it is the much less rare LED (or CFL?) variant, not the dim orange sodium lamp variety I was hoping to capture.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--toft-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/toft_top.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/toft_top-t.JPG" alt="A photo taken looking down from a ledge onto a clearing surrounded by dense greenery."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/toft_top.html">Getting up here wasn't fun, but was so worth the experience lol</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--rails path-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/rails_path.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/rails_path-t.jpg" alt="A photo of some clouds decreasing in density as their position becomes closer to the camera with the lights from a nearby village visible in the distance and a silhouette of some bushes and a railway pylon on the right."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/rails_path.html">I really love how the clouds turned out here, this was taken as one of a series of photos to see what the "Save RAW images" (Something like that ig) option does on Pixel phones and what format it saves it in, Because every manufacturer needs a different RAW format of course! Standardisation is kinda cringe anyway.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--rails dark-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/rails_dark.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/rails_dark-t.jpg" alt="An image taken with the camera facing some train tracks while angled slightly up to create a silhouette of the pylons and power lines against the night sky. There is an orange light in the distance from a rail signal."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/rails_dark.html">This image goes along with the reocurring theme of pointing the camera into the sky and hitting the shutter button, I really do need more interesting things to take pictures of, like <a id="lamp-post" href="http://blobbyspurplesite.raspberryip.com/photos-DSC00643.html">lamp posts</a> for example, 
          if I could capture the ever decreasing presence of a lamp post boasting a traditional sodium lamp that would be cool...</a></p>

    <!-- stanley -->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/stanley.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/pussy-t.jpg" alt="An image of a cat asleep on a windowsill resting its head on a white folded towel. There is a passing car vivible out of the window behind although greatly out of focus."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/stanley.html">This is a photo of Stanley, my boyfriend's cat, he is very fluffy however most of the time he's super shy, however when he isn't he is super friendly! sadly his presence triggers my allergies uwu</a></p>

    <!--clouds-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/clouds.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/clouds-t.jpg" alt="A slightly blurry photo of the night sky with little to no detail apart from some weak moonlight shining through here and there."></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/clouds.html">This is a picture I took by pointing my camera into the clouds when it was almost pitch black out, works well as a background don't you think?</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!--pretty cloud-->
    <div class="tile">
      <a href="./gallery/pretty_cloud.html"><img src="./images/thumbnails/pretty_cloud-t.jpg" alt="A photo of a cloud being lit from behind by the moonlight with the silhouette of bushes seen in the distance"></a>
      <div class="caption">
        <p><a href="./gallery/pretty_cloud.html">This is a stunning picture of a cloud I took while out on a walk, in reality I couldn't see 3m in front of me without a light source, Pixel night mode really shines through here.</a></p>
