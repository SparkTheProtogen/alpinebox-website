            <p><a href="./gallery/pretty_cloud.html">This is a stunning picture of a cloud I took while out on a walk, in reality I couldn't see 3m in front of me without a light source, Pixel night mode really shines through here.</a></p>

            <p><a href="./gallery/rails_dark.html">This image goes along with the reocurring theme of pointing the camera into the sky and hitting the shutter button, I really do need more interesting things to take pictures of, like <a id="lamp-post" href="http://blobbyspurplesite.raspberryip.com/photos-DSC00643.html">lamp posts</a> for example</a></p>

          <div class="caption">
            <p><a href="./gallery/rails_path.html">I really love how the clouds turned out here, this was taken as one of a series of photos to see what the "Save RAW images" (Something like that ig) option does on Pixel phones and what format it saves it in, Because every manufacturer needs a different RAW format of course! Standardisation is kinda cringe anyway.</a></p>
